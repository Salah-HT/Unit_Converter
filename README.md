# Unit Converter

A simple and efficient unit conversion tool for converting between kilometers and miles.

## Description

This is a straightforward unit converter that allows users to quickly convert distances between the metric system (kilometers) and the imperial system (miles). Whether you're planning a road trip, working on a project that requires unit conversions, or just curious about distances in different measurement systems, this tool provides instant and accurate conversions.

## Features

- **Kilometers to Miles Conversion**: Convert any distance from kilometers to miles
- **Miles to Kilometers Conversion**: Convert any distance from miles to kilometers
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: Clean interface with minimal complexity
- **Accurate Calculations**: Uses precise conversion formulas
  - 1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles
  - 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites are required for this simple project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Salah-HT/Unit_Converter.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Unit_Converter
   ```

## Usage

The converter allows bidirectional conversion between kilometers and miles:

- **To convert from kilometers to miles**: Enter the distance in kilometers
- **To convert from miles to kilometers**: Enter the distance in miles

### Example Conversions

- 5 kilometers = 3.107 miles
- 10 miles = 16.093 kilometers
- 100 kilometers = 62.137 miles
- 26.2 miles (marathon) = 42.165 kilometers

## Technologies Used

- Simple conversion algorithms
- Standard mathematical operations
